<p><strong>Andrew Ying</strong><br />
Rising Stanford Freshman Andrew Ying is a 2017 graduate of Cherry Creek High School. In his senior year, Andrew was accepted to Stanford University, Harvard University, the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, and the Founding Class of the ultra-selective Management, Entrepreneurship, and Technology (M.E.T.) Program at the University of California, Berkeley. Andrew has worked with hundreds of students through the Denver Math Club and Colorado MCS Camp, both organizations that he co-founded during his high school career, and is a sought-after speaker in the Colorado community on topics ranging from motivation to entrepreneurship.</p>

<p><strong>Parker Revers</strong><br />
As a current sophomore at the University of Notre Dame, Parker comfortably knows exactly what it feels like to be in your shoes.</p>

<p>While originally an English and Economics major at ND, Parker internally transferred across several colleges and is now pursuing a STEM major in Business Analytics coupled with a liberal arts major in History. While Notre Dame has been a dream of his since childhood, he was also accepted into Johns Hopkins, UChicago, Cornell, Michigan, and was offered a presidential scholarship to USC during his senior year of high school.</p>

<p>Outside of the classroom at Notre Dame, Parker conducts research on renewable energy in rural areas with guidance from the Nanovick Institute, is a History Department student worker, is a Fellow for the College of Arts and Letters, consults South Bend nonprofits on a variety of issues with SCNO, and, with only a few black eyes, boxes for the Notre Dame Boxing Club. This summer 2017, Parker lived in the tribal villages of Bangladesh, conducting research and teaching English to non-English speakers.</p>

<p>During high school, Parker was heavily involved in Speech and Debate, a medical nonprofit, National Honor Society, soccer, and his own quirky fish business.</p>

<p>Know that college was on Parker&rsquo;s mind from a young age: since 5th grade, he&rsquo;s had a Notre Dame poster taped on the ceiling above his bed so ND is the first and last thing he sees every day - and college, a marvelous paradox of ending and beginning - is still on his mind. That&rsquo;s why at  Janus Admissions Parker wants to take his passion about college apps and share them with YOU.</p>
