<h2 id="andrew-ying">Andrew Ying</h2>

<p>Stanford Undergraduate Andrew Ying is a 2017 graduate of Cherry Creek High School. In his senior year, Andrew was accepted to <strong>Stanford University, Harvard University, the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT), and the Founding Class of the Ultra-Selective Management, Entrepreneurship, and Technology (M.E.T.) Program at the University of California, Berkeley.</strong></p>

<p>Andrew has worked with hundreds of students through the <strong>Denver Math Club</strong> and <strong>Colorado MCS Camp</strong>, both organizations that he co-founded during his high school career. He coached the math club at Campus Middle School, which is comprised of over 40 students, to their <strong>first state title in decades,</strong> and he is a <strong>sought-after speaker in the Colorado community</strong> on topics ranging from motivation to entrepreneurship.</p>

<p>Name anything in the world, and Andrew can and will find something he loves about it (if he hasn’t already!) <strong>He is Michael Phelps’ #1 fan,</strong> and also plays football, tennis, basketball, and violin. Andrew immersed himself in debate in high school, dabbling in Public Forum, Lincoln Douglas, and Policy Debate, as well as Extemporaneous Speaking.</p>

<p>Through these teaching experiences, activities, and own personal journey, Andrew has developed core values of <strong>inspiration</strong>, <strong>collaboration</strong>, and <strong>listening</strong> that make him the ideal guide to help you through the grueling college admissions process.</p>

<h2 id="parker-revers">Parker Revers</h2>

<p>As a current sophomore at the University of Notre Dame, Parker comfortably knows exactly what it feels like to be in your shoes.</p>

<p>While originally an English and Economics major at Notre Dame, Parker internally transferred across several colleges and is now pursuing a <strong>STEM major in Business Analytics</strong> coupled with a <strong>liberal arts major in History</strong>. Parker’s versatility and hunger for all types of knowledge makes him especially suited to working perfectly with you, <em>no matter what interests you may have!</em></p>

<p>While Notre Dame has been a dream of his since childhood, he was also accepted into the <strong>Ivy League’s Cornell University, the University of Chicago, Johns Hopkins University, the University of Michigan,</strong> and was offered a <strong>presidential scholarship to the University of Southern California</strong> during his senior year of high school. Parker’s experience in developing and polishing successful applications to this wide variety of schools ensures that, no matter what schools you’re looking at, Parker has you covered with his expertise on how to write your application to most impress the officers who review your application.</p>

<p>Outside of the classroom at Notre Dame, Parker conducts research on renewable energy in rural areas with guidance from the <strong>Nanovick Institute,</strong> is a History Department student worker, is a Fellow for the College of Arts and Letters, consults South Bend nonprofits on a variety of issues with SCNO, and, with only a few black eyes, boxes for the <strong>Notre Dame Boxing Club.</strong> This summer (2017), Parker lived in the tribal <strong>villages of Bangladesh,</strong> conducting research and teaching English to non-English speakers.</p>

<p>During high school, Parker was heavily involved in Speech and Debate, a medical nonprofit, National Honor Society, soccer, and <strong>his own quirky fish business.</strong></p>

<p>Know that college was on Parker&rsquo;s mind from a young age: since 5th grade, he&rsquo;s had a Notre Dame poster taped on the ceiling above his bed so ND is the first and last thing he sees every day - and college, <strong>a marvelous paradox of ending and beginning</strong> - is still on his mind. That&rsquo;s why at Janus Admissions Parker wants to take his passion about college apps and share them with YOU.</p>
