      <p><strong>What parts of the college application process do you cover?</strong><br />
We offer a one, simple &ldquo;Complete Commitment Package&rdquo; which includes:<br />
1. Common Application Essay / Personal Statement<br />
2. Activities Section<br />
3. Additional Info Section<br />
4. All supplemental essays for all schools<br />
5. Interview Preparation</p>

<p><strong>How do we interact?</strong><br />
Session occur online via Skype, email, and Google Docs.</p>

<p><strong>Do you write essays for students?</strong><br />
No. All of the students we work with have the talent to craft an incredible application. We help guide them to such.</p>

<p><strong>What if the student isn&rsquo;t great at writing?</strong><br />
More work. Simple. That&rsquo;s what we&rsquo;re here for.</p>

<p><strong>Advice for choosing schools?</strong><br />
Shoot your shots wisely: have a few reach schools, a few matches, and a few backups. We’re happy to have a discussion to craft a school list.</p>

<p><strong>Can I see sample essays?</strong><br />
For privacy reasons, we do not provide current clients’ essays. However, Andrew and Parker are both happy to share their own essays with you.</p>

<p><strong>What&rsquo;s the cost?</strong>.<br />
Before September 1? $1500.<br />
September 1 onward? $1800.<br />
No surprises. No fluff. Start to finish.</p>

<p><strong>You&rsquo;re far away. Is online support effective?</strong><br />
Yes! The college application process works perfectly over long distances because while one person writes, edits, or reads, the other person is waiting. This is inefficient. Additionally, a lot of inspiration comes at odd hours of the day - walking to class, on the toilet, 3am - whenever, wherever, the student as well as Andrew and Parker are able to communicate back and forth electronically. The teen will never feel alone through the entire process.</p>

<p><strong>How does payment work?</strong><br />
There is a 50% deposit once we start. You&rsquo;re paying for detailed support from students who know the process inside and out. The rest of the balance is due 30 days from the start date.</p>

<p>Payment is made via check (preferred) to:<br />
Janus Admissions<br />
PO Box 372275<br />
Denver, CO 80237</p>

<p><strong>What&rsquo;s a reasonable response time from Andrew and Parker?</strong><br />
Always within 1 to 3 days. Always as soon as possible.</p>
